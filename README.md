# About This Task & Repo
First task completed. Here is a video in the working state: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLYyRWThKCE

"Player name (saving data between scenes)
Create a new Start Menu scene for the game with a text entry field prompting the user to enter their name, and a Start button.
When the user clicks the Start button, the Main game scene will be loaded and their name will be displayed next to the score. 
High score (saving data between sessions):
As the user plays, the current high score will be displayed on the screen alongside the player name who created the score.
If the high score is beaten, the new score and player name will be displayed instead.
The highest score will be saved between sessions, so that if the player closes and reopens the application, the high score and player name will be retained."

Will add the optional extra features in the next commits. Extra Features include:

"Create a separate High Score scene that displays the high score.
Display multiple high scores instead of just one.
Create a Settings scene that allows users to configure gameplay, and use that information between sessions. "
